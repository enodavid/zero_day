##### ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY

This repository was created to help me learn how to add a remote repository on github to my local linux machine.

As a windows user, I had to create my local machine first. This was done using Vagrant. It turns out though, that Vagrant is one of several ways of doing this, with VirtualBox and the Window Subsystem for Linux (WSL) functionality being others.

Although this repository was created with github's graphical interface, all sub-directories and README files will be added using my local linux machine running on Vagrant.
