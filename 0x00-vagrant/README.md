##### My Vagrant Project

Virtual machines are *substitutes* for real computers, yet can be made to run entire operating systems. This powerful technology allow for a lot of flexibility in software development as well as increased productivity and cost savings.

Vagrant comes in here as a software that helps to *maintain* these virtual machine environments.

This project was designed to teach me how to install Vagrant, spin an Ubuntu Linux distribution on it, create a local repository and subsequently sync said repository with a remote one on Github.
